    <h1>Working of nickel metal hydride</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        Nickel hydride batteries, commonly known as Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries, are rechargeable energy storage devices. Here's a breakdown of how they work:

        Structure
        Electrodes: NiMH batteries consist of a positive electrode made of nickel oxide hydroxide (NiOOH) and a negative electrode composed of a metal hydride (typically a hydrogen-absorbing alloy).
        Electrolyte: An alkaline electrolyte, usually potassium hydroxide (KOH), facilitates the movement of ions.

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        Operation
Discharge Process:

When the battery is in use, nickel oxide hydroxide at the positive electrode reacts with hydrogen ions (protons) released from the metal hydride at the negative electrode.
The reaction at the positive electrode can be represented as:
NiOOH
+
H
2
→
Ni(OH)
2
+
H
2
O
NiOOH+H 
2
​
 →Ni(OH) 
2
​
 +H 
2
​
 O
At the negative electrode, the reaction is:
MH
+
OH
−
→
M
+
H
2
O
MH+OH 
−
 →M+H 
2
​
 O
As a result, electrons flow through the external circuit from the negative electrode to the positive electrode, providing electric power.
Charge Process:

When charging, the reactions are reversed. The external power source forces the electrons to flow back into the battery.
At the positive electrode:
Ni(OH)
2
+
H
2
O
→
NiOOH
+
H
2
Ni(OH) 
2
​
 +H 
2
​
 O→NiOOH+H 
2
​
 
At the negative electrode:
M
+
H
2
O
→
MH
+
OH
−
M+H 
2
​
 O→MH+OH 
−
 
This restores the original materials and allows the battery to be reused.

<h1>Construction</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">The construction of Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries involves several key components and materials. <br> Here’s an overview of their construction:
<br>
    1. Cell Components
    Positive Electrode (Cathode):
    
    Made from nickel oxide hydroxide (NiOOH).
    The material allows for the absorption and release of protons during discharge and charge cycles.
    Negative Electrode (Anode):
    
    Composed of a metal hydride (MH), which typically includes alloys like lanthanum, nickel, cobalt, and other rare earth metals.
    This electrode stores hydrogen ions during the charging process.
    Electrolyte:
    
    An alkaline solution, commonly potassium hydroxide (KOH), serves as the medium for ion transport between the electrodes.
    The electrolyte facilitates the movement of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) during the electrochemical reactions.
    <br>
    2. Separator
    A porous separator (often made from materials like polypropylene or polyethylene) is placed between the positive and negative electrodes.
    The separator prevents electrical contact between the electrodes while allowing the flow of ions.
    <br>
    3. Current Collectors
    Positive Current Collector:
    Usually made from nickel or nickel-plated steel, it conducts electrons from the positive electrode to the external circuit.
    Negative Current Collector:
    Typically composed of a conductive metal like nickel, it allows electron flow from the external circuit to the Negative 
    <br>
    4. Housing
    The entire assembly is contained within a robust casing, often made of metal or plastic, to protect the internal components and maintain structural integrity.
    The casing may also include vents to allow for gas release during charging or discharging.
    <br>
    5. Terminals
    The battery features terminals (usually made of metal) for connecting to the external circuit, facilitating the charging and discharging processes. <br>
    Construction Process <br>
    Preparation of Electrodes: <br>
    
    The positive and negative electrodes are prepared by mixing their respective materials with binders and conductive agents, then pressed into thin sheets.
    Assembly: <br>
    
    The electrodes and separator are layered together, ensuring that the separator is sandwiched between the two electrodes.
    The assembly is then placed in the housing. <br>
    Electrolyte Filling: <br>
    
    The alkaline electrolyte is introduced into the cell, soaking the electrodes and separator. <br>
    Sealing: <br>
    
    The battery casing is sealed to prevent leakage and contamination, often using welding or adhesives. <br>
    Formation: <br>
    
    The cell undergoes an initial charging and discharging cycle to activate the materials, ensuring optimal performance. <br>
    Summary <br>
    The construction of NiMH batteries combines advanced materials and careful assembly processes to create a reliable and efficient energy storage solution. Their design balances performance, safety, and environmental considerations, making them suitable for various applications.
